# 0x1C. Island Perimeter

Given a grid if a list of integers, find the perimiter of an island.
The integers are 1 and 0: 1 represents land, and 0 represents water.
Each cell is a square with a side length of one. Cells can only be
connected horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. No "lakes" exist,
and there is only one island in the given grid.
